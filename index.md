## Introduction

I am a post-doctoral researcher at [Bergamo University](https://en.unibg.it/).

I am currently working on Spatiotemporal Statistics for global scale climate data, with [Alessandro Fass√≤](https://www.unibg.it/pers/?alessandro.fasso) and [Francesco Finazzi](https://www.unibg.it/pers/?francesco.finazzi).

## Research interests

* Spatiotemporal modelling for climate data
* Geometry and statistics
* Statistical learning of nonlinear data
* Constructions of kernels for Gaussian modelling and machine learning
